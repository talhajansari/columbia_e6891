============================

Repository for Columbia University course CSEE6891: Reproducing Computational Research. The work done is aimed at reproducing the paper 'Data mining applied to acoustic bird species recognition' Vilches, E., Escobar, I. A., Vallejo, E. E., &amp; Taylor, C. E. (2006, August). In Pattern Recognition, 2006. ICPR 2006. 18th International Conference on (Vol. 3, pp. 400-403). IEEE.

Instructions:
- In order to get started with my reproduction package, please download the bird sounds data from <Google Drive Link>*, unpack the .zip file in the source folder. 
- Run the script functions.py to create a python table of the soundfiles.
- Extract Features ---- (not wokring - Soundruler is giving problems, and is confusing)
<!-------- dead block --------!> 
- Implement the ID3 ---- (can't do it unless I have the features)
- Implement the Naive Bayes ---- (can't do it unless I have the features)
- Implement the K-NN ---- (can't do it unless I have the features)

* Please contact tja2117@columbia.edu to discuss how to get the data.
