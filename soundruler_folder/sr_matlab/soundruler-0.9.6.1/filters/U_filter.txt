Sound Ruler - Tuning Curve Filter

U filter

	Below 800 Hz and above 4 kHz, the filter reduces
the amplitude by 18 dB (1/8 original amplitude). 
	This example shows how the filter building 
algorithm tends to round up the filter function. Independent
of the filter order, if a V filter is specified with only 3
points, a U shaped filter is produced instead.
