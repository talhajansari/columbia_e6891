---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1- Sound Ruler release types:

    MS Windows stand alone (soundruler-0.9.x.x.windows.exe)
	You do not need Matlab to run it.

    OSX (Mac) stand alone (soundruler-0.9.x.x.osx.pkg)
        You do not need Matlab to run it.

    Unix (Linux) stand alone (soundruler-0.9.x.x.linux.tar.gz)
        You do not need Matlab to run it.

    RPM Linux stand alone (soundruler-0.9.x.x.linux.rpm)
        You do not need Matlab to run it.

    M-files script (soundruler-0.9.x.x.scripts.zip)
	Requires Matlab to run.
        It runs on any platform.


   NOTE:
      In comparison with the binary versions, the script version:
         Is slower.
         It allows you to adjust the code to fit your needs.
         It requires Matlab as it runs inside it.

     2- System requirements:

     Sound Ruler itself does not demand many resources, but sound
analysis is very processor intensive. The more extensive and detailed 
your analyses are, the more you will benefit from a fast computer.

     Although Sound Ruler runs well in a Pentium 2 at 233 MHz, even an 
upgrade from a Pentium 4 at 1.7 GHz to a Pentium 4 at 2.4 GHz can 
produce pronounced reduction in analysis time.

     Stand alone MSWindows version:

          Pentium 100 (486 not tested yet) 
          32 MB of RAM memory 
          50 MB of free hard disk space 
          Windows 95 or newer

     Stand alone Linux version:

          100 MHz processor 
          32 MB of RAM memory 
          50 MB of free hard disk space
          X windows
          Sox (for playing sounds)

     M-files script versions:
          Matlab version 6.x 
          10 MB of free hard disk space 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     3- Installation / Removal - Windows stand alone

     3.1- Can Sound Ruler coexist with Matlab installations?

     Yes, The past issues with path setting should be gone. SoundRuler now 
installs the Matlab libraries in its own directory and does not place any
setting in the general path. 


     Installation:

     1- Open a terminal and enter su to become superuser.
     
     2- tar -xvzf /path_to_package/soundruler-0.9.6.1.tar.gz

     3- cd soundruler-0.9.6.1

     4- make install

     To run the program open a terminal and enter soundruler, 
         or simply sruler.

     Requirements: bash and libXp.so.6
     libXp.so.6 was originally in XFree86-libs, which was removed from 
Fedora and other modern distributions. The requirement can be met by 
installing libXp (Fedora Core 5-6, from rpmfind.net) or 
xorg-x11-deprecated-libs (Fedora Core 1-4) instead.
